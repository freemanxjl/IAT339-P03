Starting from the smallest elements - the “Atoms”, elements like links, paragraphs, images, and buttons were designed first. From there, I combined the atoms together to build the “Molecules” such as the navbar, product item, checkout cart, and payment form. These components were then used to create “Template” pages to establish how the overall site would look and feel. </p>\r\n            <Swiper\r\n            spaceBetween={10}\r\n            slidesPerView={1}\r\n            pagination\r\n            loop\r\n            navigation\r\n            style={{margin: '2rem 0 2rem 0'}}\r\n            >\r\n                <SwiperSlide>\r\n                    <Image fluid src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/tamooki-5.png`}/>\r\n                </SwiperSlide>\r\n                <SwiperSlide>\r\n                    <Image fluid src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/tamooki-4.png`}/>\r\n                </SwiperSlide>\r\n                <SwiperSlide>\r\n                    <Image fluid src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/tamooki-7.png`}/>\r\n                </SwiperSlide>\r\n            </Swiper>\r\n\r\n            <p>Prior to building the elements, I explored a bit with the branding components and the overall art direction. This included choosing the right typeface and colors that I wanted to represent my brand. My main inspiration for the site was from the game Animal Crossing. The vibrant, soft colors and relaxing tone of Animal Crossing was how I imagined the site to look like. From there, I explored similar websites and themes to help develop the right color pallet and choice of typeface. As well, I created several resources like potential products, a logo, and decorative elements to help establish my brand components and art direction further.</p>\r\n            <p>Overall, I used this project as an opportunity to experiment with my usage of colors and try new ways to layout a site that I haven’t tried before. As well, I’ve always had an idea to open a cookie shop so this project was a way to flesh out what I wanted to create potentially in the future.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default ProjectTwo\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
